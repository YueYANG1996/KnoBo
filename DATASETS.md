## Instructions on datasets preparation
You need to download the images of each dataset from their original sources. We recommend downloading the images to the `data/datasets/` directory. If you choose to download the images to a different directory, please make sure to update the path in the scripts accordingly. Please refer to the following instructions for more details.
